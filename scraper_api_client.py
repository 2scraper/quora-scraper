"""quora-scraper — 2captcha Scraper API edition (fourth engine)

One HTTP request per page, no local browser, no Playwright install. The
2captcha Scraper API fetches the page from its own infrastructure and returns
the HTML; this client parses it with the same `product_parser` the browser
engines use, so the rows and columns are identical.

WHAT IT GETS, AND WHAT IT CANNOT GET — measured 2026-09-15, $0.0005 a request
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This path is unusually good on one URL kind and useless on another, and the
reason is the same fact that shapes the whole repo: Quora renders nothing on
the server, but it does inline its own GraphQL results into the response.

    a QUESTION url    HTTP 200, 264,581 bytes
                      6 answers, 6 of 6 payload-backed
                      upvotes, views, creationTime, numeric ids and the FULL
                      answer text all populated

    a TOPIC url       HTTP 200, 99,833 bytes
                      3 inline payloads carrying 0 Answer objects
                      0 rendered cards -> 0 rows, classified `shell`

So it is the RICHEST path this repo has, per row, on a question page — better
than a browser engine's first batch, which reads most of its rows off cards
that carry none of those columns. And it cannot read a topic feed at all,
because a topic's answers arrive over a later XHR and this returns the served
response rather than a rendered DOM.

`--wait-element` does not change that, which was worth checking rather than
assuming: the same topic URL with `--wait-element 'a.answer_timestamp'` spent
sixteen seconds instead of three and returned the same 99,847-byte shell with
the same 0 cards. Whatever the API waits on, it is not handing back the
hydrated document.

What is missing on both is any completeness oracle — but the browser path has
none either, because Quora publishes no per-page counter anywhere (see
`page_flow.page_gap`). The difference is that a browser engine can keep
scrolling and this cannot.

So: reach for this when you want a question's answers cheaply and in full, and
use a browser engine when you want a topic feed or more than the first batch.
